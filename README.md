# Astro-Pi-2019
 OBA's Astro Pi entry.

 My python program was run for 3 hours on the ISS, this repo contains the data and programs associated with that flight.

 The photos taken on flight and a video of them all strung together is available at https://jayhal.es/shared/astro-pi.

 At the current time the CSV file of the initial data, including longitude and latitude, has been converted into JSON and a crude HTML5 canvas project was created but suffered from performance issues when loading in the large amounts of images. If you download and unzip the images into a cloned repository the .gitignore file will not attempt to commit or push the files. Note the file must be called "images".

 ## Download and unzip the file: ```https://jayhal.es/shared/astro-pi/compressed-images.zip``` into a file called ```images``` in the repo.
