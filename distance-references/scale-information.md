# Distance references

The FOV of the camera was unknown so therefore I had to find an alternative solution when finding the scale of the images.
One of the most obvious and large landmarks the Dakar peninsular. I used Google Maps to find the distance between the most southern part of the outcrop to the most northern tip of the island containing Delta du Saloum National Park.

![Google Maps screenshot with line drawn between the two points with the text "11.73km" between the two"](./map-with-measurement-km.png)

The distance in pixels between the two is 514.6px and the distance in kilometres in 111.73km.

514.6 / 111.73 = 4.60575

Therefore 4.60575 pixels per km.

There are 111.12km in 1 degree.

4.60575 * 111.12 = 511.79094

## 512.71209 pixels per 1 degree

1 / 511.79094 = 0.00195

## 0.00195 degrees per 1 pixel
